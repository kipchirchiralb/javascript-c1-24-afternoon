console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"])); // Output: "fl"

- Write a function removeDuplicates(nums) that takes a sorted array of numbers nums and modifies it in-place to remove duplicate elements, returning the new length of the unique elements.

- Write a function countVowels(str) that takes a string str and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) found within the string (case insensitive).

- Write a function sumEvenNumbers(nums) that takes an array of numbers nums and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.

- Write a function findMissingNumber(nums) that takes an array nums containing consecutive numbers (except for one missing number) from 1 to n (inclusive) where n is the length of the array. The function should return the missing number.

- Write a function mergeSortedArrays(nums1, m, nums2, n) that takes two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 where m is the length of elements currently in nums1 (may have trailing zeros) and n is the length of nums2. The function should modify nums1 in-place by merging nums2 into it while maintaining the sorted order.
