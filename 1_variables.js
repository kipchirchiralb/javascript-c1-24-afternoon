// variables -- containers to stor data for our program

// in js we create/initialize variables using let,var,or const keywords
// var is an old way of creating variables that intriduced too many bugs/problems in code, therefore, let and const were introduced

// const is used to create variables that store data that does not change in the application as it runs
// let is used to to create varables whose values change over time
var userEmail = "al@hgh.com"
let username = "albert"
username = "caleb"
username = "calvin"
console.log(username) 

const adminAcc = "admin@domain.com"

// adminAcc = "new@admin.com"

// in development, we can use console.log() function to check state of our variables
